  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> August 2025</p>

  <p>
    Docs Style Explorer is a Chrome extension designed to help users scan and bulk-format text styles in Google Docs.
    Your privacy is important to us, and this extension has been built with a “privacy-first” approach.
  </p>

  <h2>What the extension does</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Scans the Google Docs document you explicitly open.</li>
    <li>Detects text styles (headings, fonts, colors, lists, etc.).</li>
    <li>Applies formatting changes that you choose (e.g., color, size, highlight).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data collection</h2>
  <p>
    This extension <strong>does not collect, store, or share</strong> any personal data.  
    All processing happens locally in your browser with your active Google Docs session.  
    We do not run servers or transmit your content externally.
  </p>

  <h2>Permissions</h2>
  <p>
    The extension requests limited permissions to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Access the current Google Docs file (to read and apply styles).</li>
    <li>Use the Google Docs API with your permission via OAuth.</li>
    <li>Store your extension settings (locally in your browser).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These permissions are used solely to provide the described functionality and nothing else.
  </p>

  <h2>Your control</h2>
  <p>
    You can revoke the extension’s access at any time via your Google account permissions
    (<a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions" target="_blank">Google Account Settings</a>)
    or by uninstalling the extension from Chrome.
  </p>
